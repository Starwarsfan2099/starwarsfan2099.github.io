### Challenge 10 Part 1 – 15pts

> At the time of the RAM collection there was an established connection to a Google Server. What was the Remote IP address and port number? format: “xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxx”

Looking at the reference page for commands, the main command useful for Windows 7 profiles is `netscan`. This command "*finds TCP endpoints, TCP listeners, UDP endpoints, and UDP listeners. It distinguishes between IPv4 and IPv6, prints the local and remote IP (if applicable), the local and remote port (if applicable), the time when the socket was bound or when the connection was established, and the current state (for TCP connections only).*" Using grep, we can parse the output for only connections with the `ESTABLISHED` flag.

```
> volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=Win7SP0x64 netscan | grep ESTABLISHED

0x13d48f540        TCPv4    192.168.10.146:54279           151.101.116.106:443  ESTABLISHED      -1                      
0x13ec87cd0        TCPv4    192.168.10.146:54282           172.253.63.188:443   ESTABLISHED      -1                      
0x13ece73b0        TCPv4    192.168.10.146:54281           13.35.82.31:443      ESTABLISHED      -1                      
0x13ecf8010        TCPv4    192.168.10.146:54280           13.35.82.102:443     ESTABLISHED      -1 
```

Then the Linux `whois` command can be used to  check who owns the addresses returned. In this case, the second address is owned by Google. 

```

The correct answer to this challenge is `172.253.63.188:443`. 

### Challenge 10 Part 2 – 15pts

> What was the Local IP address and port number? same format as part 1.

The answer to this challenge is also shown above on the same line as the last answer in the `netscan` output. The answer is `192.168.10.146:54282`. 

### Challenge 10 Part 3 – 10pts

> What was the URL?

Hm. Before trying to extract any Chrome history files from the memory dump, I searched to see if there were any plugins that could automatically recover the history. We know Chrome was open when the image was created and we need the URL closest to that time. [This GitHub repo](https://github.com/superponible/volatility-plugins) includes a plugin called `chromehistroy` that attempts to recover URLs, titles, times, and other information. Using the `imageinfo`, we know the date the image was processed (2020-04-20 23:23:26). We can grep for that day making sure to use `-a` to parse binary data as text due to the output formatting. 

```

   ```

   The URL that was visited closest to that time is `https://www.google.com/` and is the solution to this challenge. 

   ### Challenge 10 Part 4 – 5pts

   > What user was responsible for this activity based on the profile?

   Throughout the history and rest of the image, multiple references are made to the user `Warren`. And I believe a question last week asked a similar question. 

   ### Challenge 10 Part 5 – 10pts

   > How long was this user looking at this browser with this version of Chrome? Format: X:XX:XX.XXXXX

   Hm. Again, checking the reference page, a [section titled userassist](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility/wiki/Command-Reference#userassist) can be found. Looking at the example output, this command can show the length of time a window was in focus. Running the plugin and a grep for Chrome shows us the answer. Kinda.

   ```
   volatility -f memdump.mem --profile=Win7SP0x64 userassist | grep 'Chrome' -B 5 -A 5Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6

Entering `3:36:47.301000` as the solution returns that it is incorrect. However, looking closely at the format required by the solution reveals that the answer requires only 5 decimal places in the seconds, whereas the `userassist` command retruns six places. Sneaky Magnet, sneaky.... The correct solution is `3:36:47.30100`.
