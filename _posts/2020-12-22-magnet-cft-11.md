### Challenge 11 Part 1 – 20pts

> What is the IPv4 address that myaccount.google.com resolves to?

This challenge asks us to get the IP address that *myaccount.google.com* resolved to for the user of this machine. Searching the internet for ways to do this results in a [plugin](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/dnscache) for recovering the Windows DNS cache. However, it hasn't been updated in four years and wasn't wanting to cooperate with my Python installation. Searching through the forensics and memory forensics tools on the Kali tools page takes me to the page for [bulk_extractor](https://tools.kali.org/forensics/bulk-extractor). The tool can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/) and easily installed. The tool has a lot of options, including exporting the network activity to a packet capture.

To use it and make it quicker, we want to disable all unnecessary scanners and enable the one scanner we need that will create our output packet capture. We can do this with `bulk_extractor -x all -e net -o output_pcap memdump.mem`. The `-x all` disables all scanners, then `-e net` enables the one scanner network scanner. `-o output_pcap` is used to name the output directory and file. After running this command, we now have our packet capture found at `output_pcap/output_pcap.pcap`. Opening this up in Wireshark, we can search for the address and filter for DNS packets. This results in a match.


![Address](https://starwarsfan2099.github.io/public/2020-12-22/adress.JPG){:.shadow}{:.center}


We can see the DNS answer with the IP address. The solution to this challenge is `172.217.10.238`.

### Challenge 11 Part 2 – 20pts

> What is the canonical name (cname) associated with Part 1?

Well, this is easy. It is found in the exact same spot and can be seen in the image above. Although not titled *cname* or *canonical name* the solution to this question is `www3.l.google.com`.

Overall, probably the easiest challenges this month.
