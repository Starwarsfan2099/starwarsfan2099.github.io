### Challenge 1: Domains and Such – 15pts

> What is the IP address of the HDFS primary node?

This can probably be found several places. The first place I checked was the `/etc/network/interfaces` file on the master node. This is the interface configuration file. It's contents:

```
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
	address 192.168.2.100
	netmask 255.255.255.0
	#gateway 192.168.2.1
	dns-nameservers 192.168.2.1 8.8.8.8
	network 192.168.2.0
	broadcast 192.168.2.255

auto ens36
iface ens36 inet dhcp

#auto ens33
#iface ens33 inet dhcp
```
We can see the address and solution to the challenge right there -`192.168.2.100`. 

### Challenge 2: Domains and Such Part 2 – 5pts

> Is the IP address on HDFS-Primary dynamically or statically assigned?

The answer to this challenge also happens to be in this file. It says `iface ens33 inet static`. The answer to this challenge is `static`!

### Challenge 3: Domains and Such Part 3 – 5pts

> What is the interface name name for the primary HDFS node?

And the answer to this challenge is also on the same line (`iface ens33 inet static`). The solution to this question is `ens33`. Easy peasy.

These questions may have been the easiest ones yet! We'll have to see how difficult next week's questions are to make up for it...
